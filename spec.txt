Overview:
Now that you are familiar with designing a normalized database schema and MySQL,
your assignment is to design, implement, and interact with a database for a fictional
company, FSE EngStore, applying all the concepts we have discussed and learned thus
far.
You are tasked with creating a database system for a small e-commerce company, "FSE
EngStore”, that sells environmentally friendly products. The database should help the
company manage its products, customers, orders, and suppliers.
Develop the following application as a command line application. If you would like to
design/build a GUI, you are more than welcomed to do so but it’s not a requirement.
Requirements:
1. Database Design (Provided):
• Design a database schema with at least 5 tables: Products, Customers,
Orders, OrderDetails, and Suppliers.
• Ensure the design adheres to the principles of normalization (up to 3NF).
Clearly document the normalization process.
• Each table should have a primary key, and appropriate foreign keys should
be used to maintain referential integrity.
2. Data Manipulation and Queries:
• Populate each table with at least 10 rows of sample data.
• The tables are currently populated with a handful of records, I
need you to create more records across the 5 tables
• Write SQL queries to perform the following tasks (these should be menu
option):
• List all products that are out of stock.
• Find the total number of orders placed by each customer.
• Display the details of the most expensive product ordered in each
order.
• Retrieve a list of products that have never been ordered.
• Show the total revenue (price * quantity) generated by each
supplier.
3. Stored Procedures:
• Create a stored procedure to add a new order. This should include
inserting records into both the Orders and OrderDetails tables.
• Develop a stored procedure to update the stock quantity of a product after
an order is placed.
Deliverables:
Submit your commented source code in a zip file to Canvas. If you would like to upload
your project to GitHub you may do so and please make sure to include the link to your
repository
Grading:
Your program will be evaluated for correctness and elegance. Make sure you code
includes methods and good naming conventions. Use all the good practice methods you
have learned thus far.
